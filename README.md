# wordle
A version of Wordle coded live on my YouTube channel RasPiPkr Tutorials using Python 

Please note that the words in the file five.txt are not the words in the Official Wordle game and you can change them to be your own.

If you decide to use your own words then to avoid bugs keep the file name and a word on each line or you would need to modify the code to parse through the file.

Thank you for trying out my code
